Every now and then you may encounter a situation where for various reasons  
ODBC is the only option to access a remote system. Which is sufficient as long as you need to examine or change tables.  
But you can't directly execute some commands or change some Global.  
 
Special thanks [@Anna Golitsyna](https://community.intersystems.com/user/anna-golitsyna) for inspiring me to publish this.  

This examples provides 3 Methods projected as SQLprocedure that enable this if other ways of access are blocked.  
Typically by some firewall.  

SQLprocedure **Ping()** returns Server::Namespace::$ZV and allows to check the connection  
SQLprocedure **Xcmd(\<commandline>,\<resultvar>)**  executes the command line you submit and returns the result 
that you deposit in a variable that you named.  
SQLprocedure **Gset(\<global>,\<subscript>,\<value>,\<$data>)**  allows you to set or delete a global node   
 - \<global>  is a GlobalName in the remote namespace including leading carret; e.g. '^MyGlobal' (sql quoted!)    
 - \<subscript> stands for the complete subscript including parenthesis ;e.g. '(1,3,"something",3)'  (sql quoted!)   
 - \<$data> controls if you set the Global Node or execute a ZKILL on it; e.g. 1, 11 to set, 0,10 to ZKILL   
As you may guess by the name this is especially useful during a Global copy.  
The procedure Gset is designed to make use of [Global Scanning](https://community.intersystems.com/post/global-scanning-slicing) described earlier.  
Combined, they allow a Global copy across any ODBC connection.  

__Installation:__
- On the remote system you need the class provided with this article in OpenExchange  
- On the local (source) system you need to define the procedures as Linked SQL Procedures  
      _SMP>System>SQL> Wizards>Link Procedure_  
      at that time you local package name is defined    (in the examples I used zrccEX)   
-  If you want to run the Global copy you also need to install the 
[Global  Scanning class from OEX](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/package/Global-Scanning-and-Slicing-to-SQL)   
   (It is just for comfort)  

__Examples:__
~~~  
USER>do $system.SQL.Shell()   
SQL Command Line Shell  
[SQL]USER>>select zrcc_EX.Ping()  
Expression_1  
cemper9::CACHE::IRIS for Windows (x86-64) 2020.1 (Build 215U) Mon Mar 30 2020 20:14:33 EDT  
~~~
Check existence of Global ^rcc  
~~~  
[SQL]USER>>select zrcc_EX.Xcmd('set %y=$d(^rcc)','%y')  
ok: 10  
~~~  
Set some value to ^rcc4(1,"demo",3,4)  
~~~  
[SQL]USER>>select zrcc_EX.Gset('^rcc4','(1,"demo",3,4)','this is a demo',1)  
Expression_1  
ok: ^rcc4(1,"demo",3,4)  
~~~  
Do a global copy from ^rcc2 to ^rcc4.  
First show ^rcc2  
~~~
USER>>select reference,value,"$DATA" from rcc_G.Scan where rcc_G.scan('^rcc2',4)=1  
Reference       Value   $Data  
 ^rcc2                  10  
(1)             1       1  
(2)             2       11  
(2,"xx")                10

(4,"xx")                10  
(4,"xx",1)      "XX1"   1  
(4,"xx",10)     "XX10"  1  
(4,"xx",4)      "XX4"   1  
(4,"xx",7)      "XX7"   1  
(5)             5       1

Now run the copy to remote global  
~~~
[SQL]USER>>select zrcc_EX.Gset('^rcc4',reference,value,"$DATA")  from rcc_G.Scan where rcc_G.scan('^rcc2',4)=1  
Expression_1  
ok: ^rcc4  
ok: ^rcc4(1)  
ok: ^rcc4(2)  
ok: ^rcc4(2,"xx")  
ok: ^rcc4(2,"xx",1)  
ok: ^rcc4(2,"xx",10)  
ok: ^rcc4(2,"xx",4)  
ok: ^rcc4(2,"xx",7)  
ok: ^rcc4(3)  
ok: ^rcc4(4)  
ok: ^rcc4(4,"xx")  
ok: ^rcc4(4,"xx",1)  
ok: ^rcc4(4,"xx",10)  
ok: ^rcc4(4,"xx",4)
